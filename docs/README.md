# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management processes, workflows, and best practices. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for team members to understand how we plan, execute, and deliver projects successfully.

## Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes are structured to ensure efficient delivery, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement. Every initiative starts with a Project One-pager clarifying business needs, measurable objectives, stakeholders, and risks—establishing strong alignment and a go/no-go gateway for future planning.

Distinct roles are defined: Project Manager (PM) for delivery and risk, Product Manager (PdM) for vision and prioritization, Developers for implementation and testability, QA for validation, and Stakeholders for input and approval. These personas collaborate using iterative workflows and clear handoffs.

Execution involves daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates. Progress is visualized in boards, driven by a pull request workflow with reviews and automated tests. Blockers are escalated from team triage up to sponsor intervention. Retrospectives and a risk register underpin a culture of learning and proactive uncertainty management.

Multi-layered quality assurance is integral: unit, integration, end-to-end, security scans, and targeted manual QA. Release and deployment follow standardized checklists, ensuring controlled launches and rollback capabilities. Continuous improvement is reinforced via regular retrospectives and tracked action items, creating a transparent, adaptable environment for all team members.

## Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: encourage feedback and learning

## Project Lifecycle Stages

1. **Initiation**: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution**: build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release**: deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective**: capture learnings and next steps
